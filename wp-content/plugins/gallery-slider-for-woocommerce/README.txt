‚úÖ **Outstanding Product Gallery Slider**

Do you want to boost sales by enhancing your product page design and layout? Do you have too many images of your product?

No worries, WooGallery Slider is the perfect solution for you. This fantastic plugin can help you transform WooCommerce's default product gallery into an eye-catching product gallery slider on your product page. By displaying your product and additional variation images in an elegant slider style, you can easily attract more customer attention and increase your sales instantly.

‚úÖ **Additional Variation Images Gallery**

The plugin also allows you to insert unlimited additional images for each variation, letting potential customers see different images when switching between variations. WooCommerce offers an option to insert only one image per product variation. It means there is no option to add more than a single variation image when it is essential to show additional product images to boost sales.

To unlock this limitation, you can use the WooGallery Slider plugin. This plugin allows you to upload multiple images for each product variation. So, by using the WooGallery Slider, you can show different sets of images to potential customers when they switch between product variations such as Color, Style, and Size simultaneously.

‚úÖ **Product Video Gallery**

Easily embed videos in your product gallery along with images on your product's single page. The Lite version allows you to add only one YouTube video to the Product Gallery. In contrast, the Pro version supports unlimited videos, including self-hosted, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Facebook videos.

When potential customers watch a brief video of your product, the chances of selling it increase, which is an excellent way to market.

‚úÖ **Advanced Product Image Zoom**

Are you looking to improve your customers' shopping experience by allowing them to view your products in more detail and increase sales? The WooGallery Slider plugin can help you achieve this by providing advanced zooming features for your product images.

This plugin lets your customers get a closer and more detailed look at your products, which can significantly increase customer engagement and generate more sales for your business.

‚úÖ **Advanced Product Image Lightbox**

Do you want your customers to open the larger product image in a full-screen window to look closely at the product details and skyrocket conversions?

The WooGallery Slider plugin offers exclusively powerful lightbox functionality to open the full-size image in a modal window, allowing your customers to look closely and efficiently at the product details and boost sales.

‚úÖ **Product Featured Video on Shop/Archive/Listing Page (PRO)**

Do you want to show multiple types of product-featured videos on your Shop or Listing Pages to help customers make faster decisions?

The WooGallery Slider plugin allows you to replace the featured product images with a video and display them on your Shop or Archive Pages. The featured videos can be played in a popup or from the same page. You can easily add a WooCommerce product-featured video from the product edit page at the back office.

Moreover, you can upload or embed various types of videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook, and self-hosted sources. This way, you can provide your customers with a better understanding of your products and help them make a quicker decision.
